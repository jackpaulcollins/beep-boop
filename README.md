# Project Title

Beep-Boop translator

# Description

This translator takes in a number from a user. It then displays the number as a range, and replaces all instances of "3" with the string "I'm sorry Dave, I can't do that", all instances of "2" with "boop!", and all instances of "1", with "beep!".

If the translator gets to a double digit number it replaces the entire number with the appropriate string for whichever digit is highest in that number. For instance: 13 will become "I'm sorry Dave, I can't do that."

#Specs

Spec 1: The program asks the user for number and it displays it as a range
  input: 10

This number is five" for all instances of the number 5.
